# Improving-CAN-Bus-Security-against-Adversarial-Attacks
Implemented a novel dynamic arbitration system inspired by a research paper to counter intelligent guessing of arbitration IDs, effectively thwarting potential impersonation attacks.  
Leveraged Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyse an extensive dataset of attack and benign frames, ensuring robust detection and prevention of spoofing attempts.
Significantly enhanced the security of Controller Area Network (CAN) networks contributing to the advancement of automotive cybersecurity defences.
